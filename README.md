Breakdown Assistant – Mobile App for Vehicle Breakdown Support

Breakdown Assistant is a mobile application designed to help drivers during unexpected vehicle breakdowns. The app connects drivers with verified nearby mechanics in real time based on the type of issue and vehicle category. Mechanics can toggle their availability status, respond to help requests, and communicate directly with drivers through the built-in chat system.

The project is built using React Native for the mobile frontend and Node.js + Express + MongoDB + Socket.IO for the backend, providing fast communication and reliable data handling.
